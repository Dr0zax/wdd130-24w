                <h1>I Write Music</h1>
                <p>Synthwave / Chillsynth</p>
                <p>
                    Besides being good with computers, I am also good with music. 
                    When I was just seven years old, my mother started me on piano lessons; 
                    this is when I developed a love for music. 
                    When I was 15, I wrote and published my first song on my YouTube channel. 
                    I wrote it in GarageBand on my iPod Touch using the jazz music theory I learned from piano lessons. 
                    I have also taken up the organ, drums, and guitar. Since then, I have continued to learn, experiment, and expand my ever-growing music catalog. 
                    As of writing this, I have written 33 songs and three EPs, but there is still lots more to come. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The software I use to write my music is FL Studio Producers Edition, a DAW (digital audio workstation). 
                    I use a Yamaha MODX 7 as my main MIDI keyboard alongside a KORG Minilogue XD. 
                    I specialize in a specific genre of electronic music called synthwave, which involves capturing the sound of the 80's using drum machines and synthesizers. 
                    I use the Arturia V collection 9 and serum as my main synths. I publish my music on my YouTube channel, Soundcloud, and Bandcamp.

      <p>
        My website is a portfolio for showcasing my skills and knowledge of music and programming. There will be a page showcasing my programming skills, including the websites that I have made for this class and any other programming projects I have done. There will be a link to my GitHub. There will be another page for showcasing the music I have written, and I will include behind-the-scenes and general info about my music-making process. There will be a link to my YouTube channel, SoundCloud, and Bandcamp. The Home page will be a general about me with links to the other pages. The primary audience of this page is recruiters and employers, but it can also be for anyone interested in my work.

        <b>About me:</b>
        Hi, I'm Andrew! I enjoy programming and writing music. I've been learning programming since I was 12 and writing music since I was 15. I am currently at BYUI in Rexburg Idaho studying Software Engineering.

      <h3>My Music</h3>
      <p>
        This page will include links to my music and info about my experience writing music and my process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides being good with computers, I am also good with music. When I was just seven years old, my mother started me on piano lessons; this is when I developed a love for music. When I was 15, I wrote and published my first song on my YouTube channel. I wrote it in GarageBand on my iPod Touch using the jazz music theory I learned from piano lessons. I have also taken up the Organ, drums, and guitar. Since then, I have continued to learn, experiment, and expand my ever-growing music catalog. As of writing this, I have written 33 songs and three EPs, but there is still lots more to come. The software I use to write my music is FL Studio Producers Edition, a DAW (digital audio workstation). I use a Yamaha MODX 7 as my main MIDI keyboard alongside a KORG Minilogue XD. I specialize in a specific genre of electronic music called synthwave, which involves capturing the sound of the 80's using drum machines and synthesizers. I use the Arturia V collection 9 and serum as my main synths. I publish my music on my YouTube channel, Soundcloud, and Bandcamp.

      <h3>My Projects</h3>
      <p>
        This page will include my portfolio of programming skills, including the websites I have made for this class and the other things I have made. There will be a link to my GitHub and LinkedIn. I will also provide my experience as a programmer for those interested.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always been interested in computers, whether that be how they work or how the games I like playing were made. I was introduced to the world of computers and computer programming at the age of 12 when I received a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B for Christmas. The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B is a credit card-size computer that runs Linux and is used for home servers, emulation, and robotics, to name a few. I used it as a way to learn how to program using a book about Python and a version of Minecraft explicitly made for modification. When I was 15, I started making games on the popular game platform ROBLOX using the programming language Lua. I currently know how to program in Python, Lua, and Javascript, and I am learning C++. I am studying software engineering at BYUI, Idaho, and learning to program games as a hobby. Any game I have made will be included here, and the source code will be available to be viewed on my GitHub, but I can't promise it will be readable.

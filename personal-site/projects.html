                    I have always been interested in computers, whether that be how they work or how the games I like playing were made. 
                    I was introduced to the world of computers and computer programming at the age of 12 when I received a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B for Christmas. 
                    The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B is a credit card-size computer that runs Linux and is used for home servers, emulation, and robotics, to name a few. 
                    I used it as a way to learn how to program using a book about Python and a version of Minecraft explicitly made for modification. 
                    When I was 15, I started making games on the popular game platform ROBLOX using the programming language Lua. 
                    I currently know how to program in Python, Lua, and Javascript, and I am learning C++. 
                    I am studying software engineering at BYUI, Idaho, and learning to program games as a hobby. 
                    Any game I have made will be included here, and the source code will be available to be viewed on my GitHub, but I can't promise it will be readable.
